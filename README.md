# TODO

tomorrow - Double deep q learning, and duel q learning

1. Complete and expend on the world, with different function type

2. Use Meta Learning to relearn the weights, with an alternative paths

4. Use Meta Learning with Inverse Reinforcement Learning

5. Use Meta Learning and Transfer Learning together

6. Implement it with images and with path finding of different dimensions
