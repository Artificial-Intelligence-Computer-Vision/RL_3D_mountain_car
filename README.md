# TODO


1. Complete and expend on the world, with different function type

2. Use Meta Learning to relearn the weights, with an alternative paths

4. Use Meta Learning with Inverse Reinforcement Learning

5. Use Meta Learning and Transfer Learning together

6. Implement it with images and with path finding of different dimensions

7. Need to visualize the world to test the model by tomoerrrow and need to finish dueling q learning



# HOW IT WORKS

1. The more you train it the better the model becomes but the more time it will take for it to train
2. If you want the model to start from zero, turn transfer learning off
3. It uses all data obtain from all previous experience with the already build model to create a even better model with back probagate
